        I have several day dress patterns to choose from and I would be happy to make a dress or gown customized just
        for you!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is how it works:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Review the sample dresses shown below. Decide what style you would like.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determine what color you are looking for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact me via the contact page to place your order. You will need to have the following meaurements ready:
          Your normal clothing size; your bust, waist & hip measurements; your arm length from the shoulder to the base
          of the thumb- this will determine sleeve length; measure from the base of your neck to your natural waist-this
          will determine how long the bodice will need to be. How long do you want the skirt to be? If you will be
          wearing the dress over a hoop it will have to be longer than if you were just wearing a petty coat. I can
          wither send the gown off hemmed to your specifications or leavit as is for you to hem after you have tried it
          on. I cannot stress the importance of accurate measurements. If you are not comfortable getting these
          measurements yourself, find someone who can help you. I am sure your local fabric/craft store would be willing
          to lend you a hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the dress is completed (please allow 2-3 weeks) I will send you a photo for your approval. If you like
          what you see then payment arrangements will be made as outlined below.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pricing, Payment & Shipping: The cost for a dress is as follows: PRICING: Standard day dress - $50.00, Zuave
          Jacket and Skirt - $50.00, Fancier dresses $75.00 and up, Ridding Habits - $95 and up, Ball Gown $300.00 and
          up depending on the materials used. SHIPPING: Shipping will be based on the weight of the gown, insurance and
          your location. I will ship the item as soon as payment is received.
